# Automation Testing Framework

This repository contains an **automation testing framework** developed using **Selenium**, **Java**, and **TestNG** to test OrangeHRM website. The framework employs the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern, utilizes Excel files for data-driven testing, and generates detailed test reports using **ExtentReports**.

## Project Overview

The framework aims to automate the testing of web applications, providing a structured and maintainable approach to testing. By separating test logic from page-specific actions, the Page Object Model enhances code reusability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating web browser interactions.
- **Java**: The programming language used for developing the framework and tests.
- **TestNG**: For test execution and management.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Design pattern for creating object repositories for web UI elements.
- **Excel**: Used for data-driven testing to supply test data.
- **ExtentReports**: For generating detailed and visually appealing test reports.

## Key Features

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Improves test maintenance and reduces code duplication by encapsulating web page interactions.
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Supports reading test data from Excel files, allowing for extensive test coverage with various input scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed test reports with screenshots and logs using ExtentReports.
- **Modular Structure**: The framework is organized to allow easy expansion and addition of new test cases.
